# Day Planner
# Description
For this project, I've created a simple day planner to add tasks to your work day. Utilizing `jQuery`, `JS`, `Moment.js`, `Bootstrap` and `CSS`
the user is able to enter and save tasks adjacent to the corresponding time. When the `save button` is clicked, the task is saved 
to local storage. As time passes, the background color of the task will update.
